## Redis

This repository contains the code and resources for the Redis project.
Redis is a project that is part of the ALX Software Engineering Web Stack curriculum.
The project is designed to help us understand Redis and how to use it.

**Redis** is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.
Redis is a NoSQL database that is used to store data in key-value pairs.
Redis is also an in-memory database, which means that the data is stored in the server's RAM.
Redis is a key-value store, which means that the data is stored in the form of key-value pairs.
Redis is also a data structure store, which means that the data is stored in the form of data structures such as lists, sets, hashes, etc.

### Topics Covered

- **Redis**: We learned about Redis and how it differs from other databases. We also learned about the different data structures that Redis supports.

- **Redis CLI**: We learned how to use the Redis CLI to interact with Redis.

- **Caching with Redis**: We learned how to use Redis to cache data in an application.
