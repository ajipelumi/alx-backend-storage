## MySQL

This repository contains the codebase for ALX Backend Curriculum - MySQL.
The project is designed to help us understand how to use MySQL in a more advanced way.

**MySQL** is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.

MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses.
MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).
In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.
